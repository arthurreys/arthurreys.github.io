## About me

I'm a Data Scientist with experience and interest in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, with a Bachelor degree in Electric Engineering by the
Federal University of Santa Catarina, in Brazil.

As a Data Scientist, my work includes treating and analysing data, with particular experience in healthcare data.
I develop features and predictive Machine Learning models such as regression, multi-label classification tasks, clustering and more advanced
Deep Learning approaches such as NLP (Natural Language Processing). Additionaly, I also work to deploy and manage such models via Cloud and APIs.

Daily I use Python and its many libraries (Pandas, Plotly, Scikit-learn, Keras, Tensorflow, DVC) and SQL (BigQuery, DBT),
working in a cloud-based environment (GCP) and versionating code with Git/GitHub.

My latest work experience was leading one out of three Data Science teams, working in the end-to-end process ranging from data acquisition and treatment,
descriptive and ad-hoc analyses, modeling predictive and rule-based models, dashboards, to managing solutions in production.
